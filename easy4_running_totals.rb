# UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM - write a method
# Input
# - Array (of Integers)
# Output
# - Array w/ same num of elements as original
# Rules
# - New Array must have the same number of elements as original
# - New Array's elements but be a running total of original's elements

# EXAMPLES / TEST CASES
running_total([2, 5, 13]) == [2, 7, 20]
running_total([14, 11, 7, 15, 20]) == [14, 25, 32, 47, 67]
running_total([3]) == [3]
running_total([]) == []
# If orig. array is empty, a new empty array is returned


# DATA STRUCTURE
# Input: 
# Rules as data: 

# ALGORITHM
# - 

# CODE


running_total([2, 5, 13]) == [2, 7, 20]
running_total([14, 11, 7, 15, 20]) == [14, 25, 32, 47, 67]
running_total([3]) == [3]
running_total([]) == []
